      Science Museum. Its core target audience is primary and middle school
      children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.

    <p>
      The goal was to design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web
      presence for the client (fictional) - Community Science Museum. The site
      should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger
      audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The
      core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the
      museum.

    <p>
      This was a cross course assignment, that started as a design CA, then
      evolved into an HTML&CSS CA, and finally we added JavaScript to create an
      interactive online store to display products from an API endpoint. The
      goal was to design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web
      presence for the client (fictional) - SquareEyes.
